<!--
    Cognitive load rule is broken when: (mental effort)
    - the user requires more thought to complete an operation
    eg. thinking about where the image actually is because at first glance it isnt on the page, u have to scroll    -
    - use meaningless icons
    eg. using a cat paw next to the header?

    Kinematic load rule is broken when: (physical effort)
    - takes more effort to interact with the website
    - objects are unnecessarily far from each other
    - not keeping frequently used objects always available
    - hiding controls in layers and pages deep

    The page breaks the rule of accessibility by:
    - not easily perceivable when presented
    - nagivation of components are diffucult to follow
    - not robust, does not cooperate well with other assistive technologies
